# Iris-project-via-ML

## This is Iris Flower Species Project thorugh application of Machine learning with python programming.

### This Project was made by me in IIT, Patna during my Summer Internship.

Here some of algorithm are used that are some types of machine learning subparts algorithms of supervised and Unsupervised learning.
Algorithm used for predicting and get accuracy are -
1. Dicision tree classifier 
2. K nearest classifier
3. SVM
4. Logistic Regression 
5. metrics
6. train_test_split
We are making accuracy and prediction in Iris project through Iris Dataset.
This is easy and understable for machine learning staters( Naive )
My Codes, thinking, analytics and logic for making this prediction is unmatchable and best !!


I have written a Research papers on "Performance Evaluation of Supervised Learning for Iris Flower Species" ( http://ijirt.org/Article?manuscript=147862 )
